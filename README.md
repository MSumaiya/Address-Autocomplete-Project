## Project Name: Google Map Address Autocomplete 

## Project Description

I developed a SPA (Single Page Application) with React Js, which uses the Google Maps set of APIs to help users enter their physical address. Provides autocomplete suggestions from Google, and also shows a map when the user selects one. A manual form (with fields for Street, Zip code, City, Country) is provided as a fallback.

Key features:

- A lot cleaner markup.
- Conditionally load the Google Maps JavaScript. 
- Completely responsive 
- Used Material UI for better design
- Used .env file to hide API key
- Created separate component for Typography and color variable

## How to run this app at your local machine
- Step 1: Run the following command in command prompt in your desired folder:- git clone https://github.com/MSumaiya/Address-Autocomplete-Project
- Step 2: run the follwing command in command prompt in your desired folder(where you just cloned MovieDatabase):- cd .\address-autocomplete-project
- Step 3: run the follwing command in command prompt:- npm install
- Step 4: run the follwing command in command prompt:- npm start

## Limitations/ Future Plan 
Next time I would love to implement this project using Stencil.

## suggestion 
- Material UI can be a requirement to implment the app as it is very popular in react community.
